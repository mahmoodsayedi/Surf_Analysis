### Summary

By looking at the results, opening a surf shop would be a smart investment. This is because there is an enjoyable average temperature in two months that are 6 months apart from one another. That shows that for most months of the year, there will be enjoyable temperature for people to come and use the surf shop.

To dive a little deeper, we looked at the percipitation levels through the two months as well. The major takeaways from this analysis are:

1. The average percipitation is 0.136 inches per day in June
2. The average percipitation is 0.217 inches per day in December
3. 50% of days in June have less than 0.02 inches of percipitation and 75% have less than 0.12 inches of percipitation
4. 50% of days in December have less than 0.02 inches of percipitation and 75% have less than 0.12 inches of percipitation
5. The maximum percipitation is 4.43 inches on a single day in June
6. The maximum percipitation is 6.42 inches on a single day in December

By looking at this further analysis it shows that there is little amount of percipitation on a normal day, but there is still days with excessive rainfall. This shows that the surf shop will be able to stay open on most days while a few rainy days will help keep the island ecosystem lush and inviting to people wanting to visit the surf shop.
